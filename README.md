# Stock_Predictions
This repository contains a stock data set, an R Shiny app, and a PDF report explaining the project process and requirements.

The app can be viewed from the following link: https://mjmacgregor.shinyapps.io/Stock_Prediction/

The application allows the user to adjust the values of the opening price, minimum price, maximum price, and trade volume. The user then can click to calculate the resulting predicted closing price for the stock that is calculated using a linear regression model that is shown in the report to have very high accuracy on the stock data set. Clicking the calculate button then displays the resulting closing price, as well as the calculated percent change for the stock from its opening price to its closing price.

The report explains most of the intended applications and explanations. Understanding how a stock will perform on a day relative to its opening price can inform the holder's decisions with regard to trading. This was a very interesting project and helped me better understand how linear regression can be used to inform decisions and predict valuable information!
